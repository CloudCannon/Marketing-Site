faq:
  - question: Can I try CloudCannon for free?
    answer_html: >-
      <p>Yes, signing up for CloudCannon starts a free 30 day trial on the <strong>Pro</strong>&nbsp; plan. During this trial period you can enter a credit card and select a plan&nbsp; if you'd like to continue using CloudCannon.</p>
  - question: Can I switch plans?
    answer_html: >-
      <p>Yes, change your plan any time in <em>Account Settings.</em></p>
  - question: How am I billed when adding new users?
    answer_html: >-
      <p>CloudCannon adds a prorated charge (or refund when removing a user) to your next invoice. For example, if your team is on the <strong>Basic</strong> plan, it costs $25&nbsp; per user per month. You add a new team member 10 days into your billing period and there are 20 remaining days in the month. The per-day cost for each user&nbsp; is $25 &divide; 30, so we add on $16.66 ($25 &divide; 30 days &times; 20 days) to your next invoice.</p>
  - question: Where are CloudCannon sites hosted?
    answer_html: >-
      <p>CloudCannon uses Amazon Web Services for all infrastructure. Sites are automatically optimised and served from our custom File Server. Optimisations&nbsp; include GZIP, serving assets from a CDN and minification. CloudCannon supports <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.cloudcannon.com/hosting/options/">other hosting options</a>, including your own servers.</p>
  - question: What happens after the 30 day trial?
    answer_html: >-
      <p>If you haven't added a credit card and selected a plan, you'll be downgraded to our free plan. The free plan restricts access to your sites and removes all the shares you've made.</p>
  - question: Do I pay for another user when sharing to a client?
    answer_html: >-
      <p>No, sharing with <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.cloudcannon.com/sharing/client-sharing/">Client Sharing</a> does not count towards your total users.</p>
  - question: Do you take feature requests?
    answer_html: >-
      <p>Yes, we listen closely to our customers. <a href="mailto:support@cloudcannon.com">Contact support</a> if you have requests or feedback.&nbsp; Many CloudCannon features are driven by your feedback.</p>
  - question: How do I cancel my CloudCannon account?
    answer_html: >-
      <p>Either downgrade to the free plan or delete your account. Find these options in your <em>Account Settings</em>.</p>
