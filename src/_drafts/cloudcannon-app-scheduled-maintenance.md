Scheduled for [Jul 22, 15:00 - 19:00 NZDT](https://everytimezone.com/s/ba680b09)

During the maintenance window the CloudCannon App will be set to a read-only state for up to 4 hours. This will mean the following:

* **Editing access will be disabled**
* Sites will be served as normal
* Builds and syncs will occur as normal

This is due to a database upgrade necessary for a major release. Our aim is to ensure sites are operational and repository updates are still viable.&nbsp;

### Our Plan

As we need to update our database we are going to take the following steps:
{: .present-before-paste}

1. Disable sign ups and logins to the app.
2. Perform the necessary database updates.
3. Redeploy applications.
4. Enable sign ups and logins to the app.

### Changes

With this release we are simplifying how users and organisations are connected. We are moving the concept of a "personal" organisation to a organisation entity in itself, which will allow for personal sites ownership transfers and the ability to brand your editing experience. We will also be providing a better onboarding experience for new signups. &nbsp;
