Scheduled for [Jul 22, 15:00 - 20:00 NZDT](https://everytimezone.com/s/ba680b09){: target="_blank"}

During the maintenance window the CloudCannon App will be set to a read-only state for up to 5 hours. This will mean the following:

* **Editing access will be disabled**
* Sites will be served as normal
* Builds and syncs will occur as normal

This is due to a database upgrade necessary for a major release. Our aim is to ensure sites are operational and repository updates are still viable.&nbsp;

### Our Plan

As we need to update our database we are going to take the following steps:
{: .present-before-paste}

1. Disable sign ups and logins to the app.
2. Perform the necessary database updates.
3. Redeploy applications.
4. Enable sign ups and logins to the app.

### Changes

With this release we are simplifying how users and organisations are connected. We will be removing the concept of "personal" organisations, so that websites cannot be tied to individual users. For example, after the update a user named Jane will become the owner of a new organisation called "Jane's Organisation" that will contain all her personal sites. This will allow ownership transfers for personal sites, and the ability to brand your editing experience. We will also be providing a better onboarding experience for new signups.&nbsp; This will be conceptually clearer for existing and future applications.
