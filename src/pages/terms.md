# Terms of Service

## Overview:

We (the folks at CloudCannon) run a Website hosting service called CloudCannon (cloudcannon.com and *.cloudcannon.com) and would love for you to use it. Our service is designed to get your Website online as quickly and easily as possible. However, be responsible in what you publish. In particular, make sure that none of the prohibited items listed below appear on your site or get linked to from your site (things like spam, viruses, or hate content).

If you find a CloudCannon site that you believe violates our Terms of Service, please let us know on our support pages.

## Terms of Service:

The following terms and conditions govern all use of the CloudCannon Website and all content, services and products available at or through the Website. The Website is owned and operated by Cloud Cannon Limited. (“CloudCannon”). The Website is offered subject to your acceptance without modification of all of the terms and conditions contained herein and all other operating rules, policies (including, without limitation, CloudCannon’s Privacy Policy) and procedures that may be published from time to time on this Site by CloudCannon (collectively, the “Agreement”).

Please read this Agreement carefully before accessing or using the Website. By accessing or using any part of the Website, you agree to become bound by the terms and conditions of this agreement. If you do not agree to all the terms and conditions of this agreement, then you may not access the Website or use any services. If these terms and conditions are considered an offer by CloudCannon, acceptance is expressly limited to these terms and conditions. The Website is available only to individuals who are at least 18 years old.

### Your CloudCannon Account and Site

If you create a Website on CloudCannon, you are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and Website, and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under the account and any other actions taken in connection with the Website. You must immediately notify CloudCannon of any unauthorized uses of your website, your account or any other breaches of security. CloudCannon will not be liable for any acts or omissions by You, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions.

### Responsibility of Contributors

If you operate a Website, post material to the Website, post links on the Website, or otherwise make (or allow any third party to make) material available by means of the Website (any such material, “Content”), You are entirely responsible for the content of, and any harm resulting from, that Content. That is the case regardless of whether the Content in question constitutes text, graphics, an audio file, or computer software. By making Content available, you represent and warrant that:

* the downloading, copying and use of the Content will not infringe the proprietary rights, including but not limited to the copyright, patent, trademark or trade secret rights, of any third party;
* if your employer has rights to intellectual property you create, you have either (i) received permission from your employer to post or make available the Content, including but not limited to any software, or (ii) secured from your employer a waiver as to all rights in or to the Content;
* you have fully complied with any third-party licenses relating to the Content, and have done all things necessary to successfully pass through to end users any required terms;
* the Content does not contain or install any viruses, worms, malware, Trojan horses or other harmful or destructive content;
* the Content is not spam, is not machine- or randomly-generated, and does not contain unethical or unwanted commercial content designed to drive traffic to third party sites or boost the search engine rankings of third party sites, or to further unlawful acts (such as phishing) or mislead recipients as to the source of the material (such as spoofing);
* the Content is not pornographic, does not contain threats or incite violence, and does not violate the privacy or publicity rights of any third party;
* your Website is not getting advertised via unwanted electronic messages such as spam links on newsgroups, email lists, other blogs and web sites, and similar unsolicited promotional methods;
* your Website is not named in a manner that misleads your readers into thinking that you are another person or company. For example, your Website’s URL or name is not the name of a person other than yourself or company other than your own; and
* you have, in the case of Content that includes computer code, accurately categorized and/or described the type, nature, uses and effects of the materials, whether requested to do so by CloudCannon or otherwise.

By submitting Content to CloudCannon for inclusion on your Website, you grant CloudCannon a world-wide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, modify, adapt and publish the Content solely for the purpose of displaying, distributing and promoting your website. If you delete Content, CloudCannon will use reasonable efforts to remove it from the Website, but you acknowledge that caching or references to the Content may not be made immediately unavailable.

Without limiting any of those representations or warranties, CloudCannon has the right (though not the obligation) to, in CloudCannon’s sole discretion (i) refuse or remove any content that, in CloudCannon’s reasonable opinion, violates any CloudCannon policy or is in any way harmful or objectionable, or (ii) terminate or deny access to and use of the Website to any individual or entity for any reason, in CloudCannon’s sole discretion. CloudCannon will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid.

CloudCannon has a soft limit for the number sites a customer is allowed under our "Unlimited site" plans. This is in place to prevent abuse. CloudCannon will increase this limit for legitimate usecases.

CloudCannon also has a soft limit on the amount of bandwidth used on sites. For regualar customers, this is not something to worry about. Only illegitimate users have reached this limit.

The services CloudCannon provides are for the purpose of business, and therefore is not governed by the Consumer Guarantees Act.
