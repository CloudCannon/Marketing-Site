# Privacy Policy

Your privacy is critically important to us. At CloudCannon we have a few fundamental principles:

* We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.
* We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
* We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.

Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these principles. If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact our support team.

Cloud Cannon Limited. (**“CloudCannon”**) operates the website cloudcannon.com. It is CloudCannon’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites (cloudcannon.com and *.cloudcannon.com.

## Information We Collect

We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so–for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better.

We collect information in three ways: if and when you provide information to us, automatically through operating our services, and from outside sources. Let’s go over the information that we collect.

## Information You Provide to Us

It’s probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us. The amount and type of information depends on the context and how we use the information. Here are some examples:

**Basic Account Information**: We ask for basic information from you in order to set up your account. For example, we require individuals who sign up for a CloudCannon account to provide a name and email address–and that’s it.

**Transaction and Billing Information**: If you sign up for a CloudCannon subscription, you will provide additional personal and payment information that is required to process the transaction and your payment, such as your name, credit card information, and contact information.

**Content Information**: You may also provide us with information about you in published content for your website. For example, if you write a blog post that includes biographic information about you, we will have that information, and so will anyone with access to the Internet, if you choose to publish the post publicly.

**Credentials**: Depending on the Services you use, you may provide us with credentials for your website (like FTP username and password).

**Communications with Us**: You may also provide us information when you communicate with our support staff.

## Information We Collect Automatically

We also collect some information automatically:

**Log Information**: Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access and operating system. We collect log information when you use our Services–for example, when you create or make changes to your website on CloudCannon.

**Usage Information**: We collect information about your usage of our Services. For example, we collect information about the actions that site administrators and users perform on a site–in other words, who did what, when and to what thing on a site (e.g., Bill deleted “Test post” at 12pm 15/02/2018). We also collect information about what happens when you use our Services (e.g., page views, button clicks) along with information about your device (e.g., mobile screen size, name of cellular network, and mobile device manufacturer). We use this information to, for example, provide our Services to you, as well as get insights on how people use our Services, so we can make our Services better.

**Location Information**: We may determine the approximate location of your device from your IP address. We collect and use this information to, for example, calculate how many people visit our Services from certain geographic regions.

**Information from Cookies**: A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. CloudCannon uses cookies to help us identify and track visitors, usage, and access preferences for our Services.

**Web beacons information**: When you use the Service, we may employ clear GIFs (also known as web beacons) which are used to anonymously track the online usage patterns of our users. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information is allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.

## Information We Collect from Other Sources

We may also get information about you from other sources. For example, if you create or log into your CloudCannon account through another service (like GitHub), we will receive information from that service (such as your username, basic profile information, and repository list) via the authorization procedures used by that service. The information we receive depends on which services you authorize and any options that are available.

## How We Use Information

We use information about you as mentioned above and as follows:

* To provide our Services–for example, to set up and maintain your account, host your website, backup and restore your website, or charge you for any of our paid Services;
* To further develop our Services–for example by adding new features that we think our users will enjoy or will help them to create and manage their websites more efficiently;
* To monitor and analyze trends and better understand how users interact with our Services, which helps us improve our Services and make them easier to use;
* To monitor and protect the security of our Services, detect and prevent fraudulent transactions and other illegal activities, fight spam, and protect the rights and property of CloudCannon and others;

## Sharing Information

### How We Share Information

We do not sell our users’ private personal information.

We share information about you in the limited circumstances spelled out below and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy:

* Subsidiaries, Employees, and Independent Contractors: We may disclose information about you to our subsidiaries, our employees, and individuals who are our independent contractors that need to know the information in order to help us provide our Services or to process the information on our behalf. We require our subsidiaries, employees, and independent contractors to follow this Privacy Policy for personal information that we share with them.
* As Required by Law: We may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request.
* To Protect Rights and Property: We may disclose information about you when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of CloudCannon, third parties, or the public at large. For example, if we have a good faith belief that there is an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury, we may disclose information related to the emergency without delay.
* Business Transfers: In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company, or in the unlikely event that CloudCannon goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would likely be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. If any of these events were to happen, this Privacy Policy would continue to apply to your information and the party receiving your information may continue to use your information, but only consistent with this Privacy Policy.
* Third Party Vendors: We may share information about you with third party vendors who need to know information about you in order to provide their services to us. This group includes vendors that help us provide our Services to you (like payment providers that process your credit and debit card information) and those that help us understand and enhance our Services (like analytics providers).

### Information Shared Publicly

Information that you choose to make public is disclosed publicly. That means, of course, that information like your public pages, posts other content that you make public on your website that use our Services, are all available to others. Public information may also be indexed by search engines or used by third parties. Please keep all of this in mind when deciding what you would like to share.

## Security
While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect information about you against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so.

## Choices
You have several choices available when it comes to information about you:

* Limit the Information that You Provide: If you have an account with us, you can choose not to provide the optional account information and transaction and billing information. Please keep in mind that if you do not provide this information, certain features of our Services–for example, paid features–may not be accessible.
* Opt-Out of Electronic Communications: You may opt out of receiving promotional messages from us. Just follow the instructions in those messages. If you opt out of promotional messages, we may still send you other messages, like those about your account and legal notices.
* Set Your Browser to Reject Cookies: At this time, CloudCannon does not respond to “do not track” signals across all of our Services. However, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies before using CloudCannon's websites, with the drawback that certain features of CloudCannon's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

## Transferring Information
CloudCannon is a worldwide service. By accessing or using the Services or otherwise providing information to us, you consent to the processing, transfer, and storage of information in and to the U.S. and other countries, which may have rights and protections that are different from those in your home country.

## Our Users’ Websites
If you are a visitor to one of our users’ websites, please note that this privacy policy doesn’t apply to you in regard to that specific site. We process information that visitors provide to our users’ websites on behalf of our users and in accordance with our user agreements. We encourage our users to post a privacy policy that accurately describes their practices on data collection, use, and sharing of personal information.

## Privacy Policy Changes
Although most changes are likely to be minor, CloudCannon may change its Privacy Policy from time to time. CloudCannon encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the change log below, and, in some cases, we may provide additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you a notification through e-mail or your dashboard). Your continued use of the Services after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your consent to such change.
