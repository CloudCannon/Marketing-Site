					<h4>Bounty Qualification</h4>
					<p>Only critical vulnerabilities that demonstrate complete compromise of the system's integrity or confidentiality are eligible for a bounty. While we encourage you to submit all potential issues, lower severity issues are not in scope at this time.</p>
					<p>It's important to keep in mind that not all submissions will qualify for a bounty, and that the decision to award a bounty is entirely at the discretion of CloudCannon. CloudCannon have the final decision on which issues constitute security vulnerabilities.</p>
					<h4>Disclosure Policy</h4>
					<p><strong>Do</strong>:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Let us know as soon as possible upon discovery of a potential security issue, and we'll make every effort to quickly resolve the issue.</li>
						<li>Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our service.</li>
						<li>Making many substantially similar reports will only be eligible for one bounty award, and marked as duplicate. For example, the same vulnerability reported across multiple sub-domains. Please consolidate issues into a single report.</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Don't</strong>:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Do not make any information public until the issue has been resolved.</li>
						<li>Do not access or modify data that does not belong to you - create a free account to test with.</li>
					</ul>
					<h4>Exclusions</h4>
					<p>While researching, we'd like to ask you to refrain from:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Denial of service</li>
						<li>Spamming</li>
						<li>Social engineering (including phishing) of CloudCannon staff or contractors</li>
						<li>Any physical attempts against CloudCannon property or data centers</li>
					</ul>
					<p><em>We do not cover TransferWise fees for international transactions, credit card transactions or any other services. TransferWise may deduct this from the amount sent to the payee.</em></p>
					<h4>Safe Harbour</h4>
					<p>Any activities conducted in a manner consistent with this policy will be considered authorised conduct and we will not initiate legal action against you. If legal action is initiated by a third party against you in connection with activities conducted under this policy, we will take steps to make it known that your actions were conducted in compliance with this policy.</p>
					<p>Thank you for helping to keep CloudCannon and our users safe!</p>
